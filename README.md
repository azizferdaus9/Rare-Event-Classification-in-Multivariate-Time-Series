**Project Overview**
In industrial settings, the ability to predict faults in machinery is crucial for maintaining efficient operations and reducing downtime. This project focuses on forecasting faults in industrial machinery using advanced machine learning (ML) methods. By leveraging evolutionary feature selectors and explainable AI-based feature identifiers, we aimed to develop robust models for early prediction of rare events, such as paper breaks, which commonly occur in the industry.

**Project Objectives**
Early Fault Prediction: Develop models to accurately predict faults in industrial machinery, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing operational downtime.
Feature Selection and Identification: Utilize evolutionary feature selectors and explainable AI techniques to identify and select the most relevant features for fault prediction.
Model Development and Implementation: Build and implement various ML algorithms to classify and predict faults with high accuracy.
**Methodology**
1. **Research and Feature Selection:** We explored relevant ML methods and conducted extensive research on evolutionary feature selectors and explainable AI-based feature identifiers. This step was crucial for understanding which features most significantly impact fault occurrence.

2. **Model Development:** Several machine learning models were developed and tested, including:

**XGBoost**
**Gradient Boosting Classifier**
**Random Forest**
These models were chosen for their effectiveness in handling classification tasks and their ability to manage complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

3. **Neural Networks for Rare Event Prediction:** We also built artificial neural networks (ANN) specifically designed to classify and predict the early occurrence of rare events, such as paper breaks, which are critical yet infrequent issues in the industry.

4. Implementation: All algorithms were implemented using Python libraries, ensuring a robust and scalable solution. Collaboration with colleagues was integral to the development of ML and deep learning-based time series analysis models, further enhancing the predictive capabilities.

**Key Results**
**High Accuracy:** The implemented models achieved an impressive 90.37% accuracy in predicting faults. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the selected ML methods and the thoroughness of the feature selection process.
**Robust Predictions:** The models were able to predict rare events like paper breaks accurately, providing valuable insights for proactive maintenance and operational efficiency.
**Impact**
**This project has the potential to:**

**Reduce Downtime:** By predicting faults early, industrial operations can schedule maintenance proactively, thereby minimizing unplanned downtime and associated costs.
**Improve Efficiency:** Accurate fault prediction helps in optimizing machinery performance and extending the lifespan of industrial equipment.
